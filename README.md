# Student-Registration-System
The objective of this project is to develop an application using Oracle's PL/SQL and JDBC to
facilitate various student registration tasks in a university. The application will provide
functionalities such as adding and dropping courses, enrolling students in classes, and
managing student records.The application will be designed to handle a large amount of data,
including student records, course details, and enrollment information. PL/SQL will be used to
write the database stored procedures that will support these operations, while JDBC will be
used to communicate with the database and execute these stored procedures
